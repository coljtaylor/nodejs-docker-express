I used [this blogpost](https://blog.logrocket.com/node-js-docker-improve-dx-docker-compose/) as my main reference, which included a full walkthrough of setting up an express application as a Docker container.
I also used [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/node-js-docker-improve-dx-docker-compose/) to learn more about npx and [this article](https://medium.com/crowdbotics/a-complete-one-by-one-guide-to-install-docker-on-your-mac-os-using-homebrew-e818eb4cfc3) to learn the basics of installing Docker on a Mac.
